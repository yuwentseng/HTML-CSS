        <p>This salad is a great addition to many meals. It can be stored 1-2 days in the fridge. If you store the ingredients seperately refrigerated you could make 2 batches over 3 days for a fresher result</p>

        <div class = 'tips'><p>Creating a stable way to hold a vegetable with fingers safely away from the knife blade is the most important consideration when chopping. Hold knife so blade moves away from you. Hold food in place with curved fingers and thumb tucked back. It is helpful to rest the smooth side of the knife against your curved knuckles as a guide - the knife blade stays close to the board and your food and your fingers are projected.</p></div>

        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash Cucumber. If you would like the peel removed or some of the peel removed, peel or slice away some of the peel. Cut the cucumber into small cubes</li>       
            <li>Wash the tomato. Slice the tomato and cut the slices into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li>Wash the parsley and remove the stems. Chop leaves</li>
            <li>Pull away the outer paper/layer of the shallot. Cut a small 1" piece off the shallot. Save the rest for another recipe by wrapping and storing in the refrigerator. Mince the shallot or chop into very small pieces.</li>
            <li>Juice the lemon. Slice the lemon in half. Using a fork, hold 1/2 of the lemon in one hand and pierce the cut side with a metal forkwith the other, over a bowl. Squeeze the lemon against the fork and twist to release the juice, catching in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine the cut vegetables in a bowl. Add the lemon juice and a little salt and pepper. If using oil, chopped garlic, or shredded mint leaves they can be added as well. Gentle mix the salad evenly.</li>

        <p>I make this omelet at least once a week. It's insanely delicious, whether laden with veggies or kept simple. I love it with dill, but it's good with almost any herb, or with scallions. I tend to use Chedder and Romano, since they go well with most vegetables. But other great combos are goat cheese with zucchini, cauliflower with sausage and chile flakes.</p>
        <p>If I'm serving two people, I usually cut one large omelet in half rather than making two. However, if you feel like being fancy, make a pair of two-egg omelets simply by using half the ingredients for each. For a French style omelet, roll it up in Step 4 instead of folding it. The result will be quite thin and tender</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>1 shallot or 1/2 small red onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the eggs, dill, salt, and pepper in a bowl, and beat with a fork</li>
            <li>Melt a small pat of butter in a big frying pan over medium-high heat. Once it's sizzling, add the shallot and saute for about 2 minutes, until it's translucent and smells great.</li>
            <li>Add the egg to the hot pan and swirl it to coat the surface evenly. If the center of the omelet cooks more quickly than the edge, use a spatula to pull any raw egg into the middle. Then stop touching it.</li>
            <li>After about 30 seconds, toss the cheese on top of the egg, along with any other raw or cooked vegetable you feel like adding. Once none of the egg remains translucnet, 30 seconds to 2 minutes, fold the omelet in half with your spatula and lift it out of the pan. You don't want any brown on your eggs.</li>
        </ol>
